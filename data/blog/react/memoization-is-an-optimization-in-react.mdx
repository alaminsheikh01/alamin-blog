In React **Memoization** is an optimization technique used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components by `remembering` the previous computation results. Memoization stores the result of expensive function calles and resuses it when the same inputs occur, which can significantly improve performance, especially in complex applications.

React provides several hooks and utilities to implement memoization, such as:

1. `React.memo()`
2. `useMemo()`
3. `useCallback()`

Let’s go through each with clear examples.


### 1. `React.memo()`
`React.memo()` is a higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes functional components. It only re-renders the component if its props have changed. This is useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components that don’t need to update.

Example using `React.memo()`


```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Expensive child component that we want to memoize
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log('Rendering ExpensiveComponent');
  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Optimizing Performance with React.memo</h1>
      <ExpensiveComponent count={count} />

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(!otherState)}>
        Toggle Other State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```


#### Explanation:

- `ExpensiveComponent` is memoized using `React.memo()`.
- Even when `otherState` changes, `ExpensiveComponent` won’t re-render because `count` (its prop) hasn’t changed.
- This reduces the re-renders of `ExpensiveComponent`, saving processing time when `otherState` changes.



### 2. `useMemo()`
`useMemo()` is a React hook that memoizes the result of a computation, preventing recalculation if dependencies haven’t changed. It’s useful for optimizing expensive calculations.

Example using `useMemo()`


```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

// A function simulating an expensive calculation
function expensiveCalculation(num) {
  console.log('Calculating...');
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {} // Simulated delay
  return num * 2;
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  // Memoize the result of the expensive calculation
  const doubledValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(count), [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Optimizing Performance with useMemo</h1>
      <div>Doubled Value: {doubledValue}</div>
      
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      
      {/* This input changes frequently but does not trigger recalculation */}
      <input
        type="text"
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type here..."
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```


#### Explanation:

- `useMemo()` memoizes the result of `expensiveCalculation(count)`.
- The calculation only runs when `count` changes, even though `input` changes frequently.
- This prevents the expensive calculation from re-running unnecessarily when `input` changes, improving performance.


### 3. `useCallback()`
`useCallback()` is similar to `useMemo()`, but it memoizes function definitions instead of values. This is particularly useful for passing stable callback functions to child components, preventing their re-renders when the parent re-renders.


Example using `useCallback()`



```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onButtonClick }) => {
  console.log('Rendering ChildComponent');
  return <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoize the click handler function to prevent re-render of ChildComponent
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Optimizing Performance with useCallback</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      
      {/* Passing the memoized function to ChildComponent */}
      <ChildComponent onButtonClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```



#### Explanation:

- `handleClick` is wrapped with `useCallback()` to memoize it.
- Even when `count` changes, `handleClick` does not change, preventing `ChildComponent` from re-rendering.
- This keeps `ChildComponent` stable, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary renders.



### Summary of Memoization Techniques

- `React.memo()`: Prevents re-renders of a component if its props haven’t changed.
- `useMemo()`: Memoizes the result of a function, optimizing performance for expensive calculations.
- `useCallback()`: Memoizes a function definition, preventing it from being redefined and causing unnecessary re-renders of child components.



These techniques help optimize React applications by reducing the number of renders and recalculations, leading to smoother, more performant applications, especially in scenarios with complex computations or large component trees.
