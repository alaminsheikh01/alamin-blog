Academic and Research:
I have a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering, with research focused on AI, ML, and NLP, including a recent publication on speech emotion recognition. I'm keen on pursuing an MSc or PhD, ideally with scholarship support due to financial constraints.

Professional Experience:
With over two years of front-end development experience, I have skilled in JavaScript, Python, React, Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. Currently a software engineer, you're seeking roles in modern web app development.

Future Goals:
I have plan to apply for international masterâ€™s programs in data science or related fields and scholarship
